# Graph-Algo-visualizer

Draw your own graphs and visualize the most common graph algorithms. This web application allows you to draw a graph from zero, with possibility of directed and weighted edges, and visualize different algorithms for graphs known in CS.

Features
1. Draw a graph, with undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted edges
2. Visualize multiple graph algorithms
3. Keep your graph in JSON format text that can be used to recover the graph in any moment

Built with
Front-end - React.js


Currently it has 7 different algorithms

1. Breadth-first search
2. Depth-first search
3. Topological sort
4. Dijkstra's algorithm
5. Bellman-Ford algoritm
6. Kruskal
7. Prim

Made in a way that is relatively simple to add more algorithms
